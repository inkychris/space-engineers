# Space Engineers In-Game Scripts
This is a collection of scripts
for use in the programmable block
in Space Engineers.

The common directory contains
generic utilities that can be
included in multiple projects.

Note that currently
the Visual Studio projects
do not make use of the `USERPROFILE`
environment variable so
`C:\Users\chris` is currently
hardcoded into this repo.
